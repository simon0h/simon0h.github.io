	<hr>
	<p> This website used Cloudflare and is hosted on GitHub pages. Cloudflare collects: </p>
	
	<p> - Unique visitors (total unique visitors over a certain time period, maximum unique visitors per time period, and minimum unique visitors per time period). </p>
	<p> - Top traffic countries/regions (i.e where website visitors are located). </p>
	<p> As far as I can tell, these are all the data that is collected by Cloudflare integration on my website. In addition, there is no way for me to tell who visited my website, only that I had X number of people visit my website and Y number of people visited from certain countries. </p>
	<p> Here is a screenshot of what I see: </p>

	<p> In addition, GitHub pages does not collect any data as far as I could tell. </p>
	<p> If I misrepresented Cloudflare analytics, please reach out so I can correct the errors. Thank you. </p>
