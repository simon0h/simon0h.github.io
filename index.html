<h3> Podcast</h3>
<p> <p class = "paragraphs"> Mills Tech Talk was a short-lived but fun experience for me. I started to listen to podcasts like Accidental Tech Podcast and The Talk Show and thought it would be interesting to make a podcast with two of my friends, Mitchel and Ryan, to talk about tech. Mitchel is a fan of Microsoft and I am a fan of Apple, so there were some moments where we had fun little arguments about these two companies. </p>
