    <h2> Indra's Net Agent-Based Modeling</h2>
    <p> <p class = "paragraphs"> I was the back-end engineer for my summer research internship under professor Eugene Callahan. We worked on Indra's Net, which is a framework for agent-based modeling similar to Net Logo but built with Python. I used Python to build out the back end frameworks and to build models. I also used little bit of Seaborn to display the data.</p>

    <h2> Podcast</h2>
    <p> <p class = "paragraphs"> Mills Tech Talk was a short-lived but fun experience for me. I started to listen to podcasts like Accidental Tech Podcast and The Talk Show and thought it would be interesting to make a podcast with two of my friends, Mitchel and Ryan, to talk about tech. Mitchel is a fan of Microsoft and I am a fan of Apple, so there were some moments where we had fun little arguments about these two companies. </p>
